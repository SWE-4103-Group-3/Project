Overview of points made during first PO-Meeting about requirements

-Typical web browser functionality.
-We will not have access to any of unb's services. (D2L, eServices)
-As of now emails will not be involved in the creation of accounts, privacy concern.
-Have not decided as of yet how to notify students with low attendence.
-Account creation will consist of username and password. (Student and Faculty)
-Students will manually select the courses they are in. 
-faculty members will be responsible for creating their courses in the app, no pre-existing courses.
-faculty can remove students from a course.
-faculty cannot assign seats, this is left up to the students.
-students will be able to switch seats if they want, but only to seats labeled AVAILABLE.
-possible chat feature for students to coordinate switching of seats. (this is likely to change)
-faculty will be incharge of creating the specific seating template for their class.
-have not yet decided how to handle labs and tutorials.
-faculty takes attendance by marking the seats which are empty, 
 otherwise student is assumed to be present.
-faculty can go back to previous dates to modify attendance.
-system always defults to current date.
-as of now attendance tracking data will appear spreadsheet style including user-> days missed or present
-will likely have Report/Queries for attendance statistics. i.e. able to look up students that missed 'x' number of days.

Two different view modes for users with accounts and users without:
    1.  both students and faculty can see the names of users associated with their selected seats.
    2.  anonymous users without account can view classes seating plans, but not the associated names.


Some classes will have optional attendance, some classes will have mandatory attendance.
    Optional-> students can choose to create an account on our app in order to pick their seat.
               there will be seats reserved for students who choose not to use the app, these seats will appear... 
               in the seating template, but will be un-available to choose by users.
    Mandatory-> It is assumed all students will be using the app.
    
Seat types:
    Closed - seats appear on template but it is apparent to students that no one is to sit there.
    Open - anyone can sit in these seats, and they cannot be reserved by students with the app.
    Reservable - these seats will be chosen by students with the app.
    
Creating template (for faculty):
    1.  Template starts as grid of max possible size. (Dineen)
    2.  Faculty selects a section they wish to use to represent their class,
        grid now resizes to fit only their selection.
    3.  Seats are then set as either Closed, Open or Reservable.
    
Questions left unanswered:
  -Can students view the templates of courses they are not in?
  -Do students have to be accepted into courses by faculty to modify seating?
